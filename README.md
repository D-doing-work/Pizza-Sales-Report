# Pizza-Sales-Report
In this Project, I used Microsoft SQL and Power BI to analyze when the busiest days and time is and which type of pizza and what pizza size contributes to the maximum sales and total orders. To deep dive more into the data I analyzed which pizza are the top 5 pizza and the bottom 5 pizza.

This helps give the results of which time is the busiest and which pizza and size was contributing for the maximum sales and total orders. Then the next dashboard shows the best seller for the revenue, quantity, and total orders as well as the worst sellers for the revenue, quantity, and total orders.
